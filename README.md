# Treat your servers like your Ruby App: Infrastructure as Code

As a Ruby developer, we are responsible for providing unit test harness to
support our development. Not only it provides a clean code base, but it also
allows you to introduce changes as the needs of your application's supported
business over time.

Putting the same effort around your application's infrastructure gives the same
benefit as well. Being able to support sudden traffic to your application is as
important as delivering features to your users.  In this talk, I will talk how
to treat your Infrastructure as Code with the same test-driven development
techniques you do in your application.  In addition intro tooling like Chef,
Test-Kitchen, and Foodcritic, I will demonstrate adding it to your application's
existing continuous delivery pipeline.
